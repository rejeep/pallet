Feature: package.el integration
  In order to keep my Cask file up to date
  As a Pallet user
  I want Pallet to react properly when I add and delete packages using package.el

  # Scenario: Adding a package via package.el
  #   Given I have initialised Pallet
  #   When I add a package via package.el
  #   Then the package should be added to my Cask file
  #   And nothing should be removed from my Cask file

  # Scenario: Deleting a package via package.el
  #   Given I have initialised Pallet
  #   When I delete a package via package.el
  #   Then the package should be removed from my Cask file
  #   And nothing should be added to my Cask file
  #   And nothing else should be removed from my Cask file

  # Scenario: Upgrading packages via package.el
  #   Given I have initialised Pallet
  #   When I upgrade packages via package.el
  #   Then my packages should be upgraded
  #   And nothing should be removed from my Cask file
